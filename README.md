- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Alphacano
I am a testnet node operator. I did not run a validator node on the mainnet, but contributed to many testnets.
Deweb, Pontem, Stride, Terp, Celestia, Nym, Nibiru, Ollo, Sei, Rebus, QuickSilver, Kujira, Nomic and 
many less known projects. I like having the freedom to try new things, working as a freelancer, and l
earning about programming and Blockchain projects. I am working for a blockchain startup. 
Iâ€™ve worked on node operations in a number of projects over the last 5 years.
